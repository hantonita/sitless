Senior Project Bellevue International School

I have chosen to address the immediate physiological impact that sitting continuously for a long period of time has on the human body. The human body is made to move but people of all ages sit for hours on end at work, at school, at home in front of the television, or in commute. Scientific studies have demonstrated that this damages the body in a way that even regular exercise cannot compensate for. 

To address this health challenge, I have developed a wearable device that records how long a person sits throughout a day and, when necessary, reminds a person to stand up. By using an acceleration sensor, a microcontroller and an SD storage card, the device records changes between sitting and standing and, if desired, provides discreet feedback to the user through a small vibration motor. I am using small open source components to make it comfortable for full-day use. A 3D-printed shell will protect all components and allow me to keep the device dimensions at a minimum.
